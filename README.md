# Skyrim Alchemy Helper

## Overview
This tool helps a player craft potions in Skyrim with their desired effects.
By selecting an effect from the provided list, the list of ingredients to create
that potion will be displayed at the bottom of the screen. 

### Background
I play a lot of Skyrim and have always loved making potions. The main issue
with new builds is I never remember what ingredients make what potions! This
tool is a tinker project to help learn some Python while being moderatly useful.
